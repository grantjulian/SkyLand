Unity files for a game I was working on a couple of years ago. It was gonna be a 3rd person rts style game where you gather resources and build a base to defend against other players. The world generates procedurally based on a seed. You can craft, place, and interact with structures and other objects. The environment is destructable using the laser in the player's inventory. HORRIBLY optimized. Ignore the issue with the package manager (just hit continue). The entire game exists within the 'main' scene.
